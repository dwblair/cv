things that could use viz

- flocking, swarming, active matter

- colloidal physics

- graph-theoretic diameter of random cluster models

- packing of polygons on compact geometries

- computational complexity

- biophysics

--- add digital labor to the mix

- add notes on coqui, links on riffle

- eieio
digital labor
collective
focus on sustainable tech
finding novels ways of assigning resources
cooperative, non-competitive practices
local production as much as possible -- jobs, environment
open source, no IP
model based on labor, with intention of sustaining it
- working with parts and crafts, pirateship, farmhack, and others on these issues -- creating sustainable infrastructure for these communities
- do outreach with scientists -- view them as knowledge workers
- connections with science for the people movement

- open pipe kit



-- parts and crafts
- talk about their relation to public lab, and interest in open water.  the diy aesthetic is shared in common. aerial mapping. a laboratory. family hackerspace idea.

-- farmhack
ongoing conversation with farmhack members about relationship between env monitoring and land use management.  exciting collaboration because farmers are interested in 'solving the problem', not just monitoring / accountability -- soil as a biological machine that can solve water quality issues and produce food.  
- attending meetups regularly
- channeling resources from medium-scale agriculture to DIY tech developers, make open source projects that are good generally
- work on FIDO, Open Pipe Kit, and other accessible platforms
- use of Riffle approach 

-- public lab fellow
- critiques of citizen science approaches
- thinking critically about public lab as an organization, long term view
- white papers and chapters, reflections
- participate in strategic discussions, finding grants
- help curate technologies and approach
- seek sustainable models 
- consistent philosophy

-- public lab organizer
- meetups in amherst and elsewhere
- online dialogues
- facilitating inclusion of 'geeks' with the activists -- straddle that line
- translation of technologies

-- pioneer valley open science institute
co-founder
- grad students from umass physics, computer science, teacher, librarian, school teacher
- reflection on open source approaches / ethos in science
- informal 'institute'
- small DBA for collecting resources
- development community for public lab and farmhack projects
- tradition of 'insitute banquets' emerging

-- NCDG
fellow, 2013-2014
- workshop on knowledge commons
- role of institutions in open source movements
- views on trends in leveraging open source labor -- 'governing the knowledge commons'
- curation of technologies and tools
- with charlie shweick, jane fountain

-- umass amherst physics department
teaching and research assistant
-- teaching assistantships
physics labs, tutoring
-- research assistantships
with jon machta, menon, muthukumar, neuroscience labs

-- makers at amherst media
collaborator
- participated in conversations about form and approach to community science and technology initiatives at amherst media, a organization with deep roots in civic engagement
- helped organize first maker event
- helped facilitate connections to others in local maker community
- worked with Jim Lescault, Charlie Schweick, Steve Brewer, others
- link to mailing list / website

-- umass open science hardware workshop
co-organizer
- focused on open source hardware for lab research
- X # of presentations, 30 participants
- connection between local community and public lab
- recommendations for next steps, creation of a community

-- hack for western mass
co-organizer
- hackathon 'local people solving local problems'
- call out to local orgs for their problems
- call out to local devs 
- pitch session
- generated results, as per poster
- intended as ongoing, annual event

-- thermal flashlight
developer
- initial arduino-based prototype for public lab idea

-- github-based publication
developer
with jeff walker
using RStudio, markdown as model 
prototyped it with some research notes
initial conversations with MIT library about modeling the approach
can include source and data in analysis using standard tools
enhanced reproducibility, version control
contributions can be attributed, timestamped

twitter analysis
developer
for ict summit, developed processing-based twitter analysis tool
- useful for generating 'live word cloud' for a topic
- idea: can click on words to pull up the tweets associated, dive into stats
- used for backchannel moderation to get a 'pulse' on a conference

infragram
web development, hardware prototyping
- prototype for plant health tool using NDVI / near infrared photosynthesis technique
- hardware prototyping and web platform prototyping

flocking, swarming
theory, simulation, experiment
inspired by menon's research
collective behavior induced by local interactions
studying aspects of end-shape dependence of density fluctuations, spatial correlations, patterns
implications for granular materials and biological systems with limited long-range sensing (bacteria)

profession
artisan's asylum: community education and support for hackery
parts and crafts: family hackerspaces
pirateship: local hackerspace with radical leanings
workshop on knowledge commons -- focused on commons-based approaches to knowledge production

skills:
- computer
- cardboard based rapid prototyping
- french
- illustration (cartoon, chalkboard)
- loud, noisy civic engagement via amplified trombones

need to time-order these things!

make sections on main page for various projects
blotbot and etc
