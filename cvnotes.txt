- Colloidal Physics
We have performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the sublimation kinetics of colloidal crystallites, and
have found an abrupt increase in the sublimation rate at a particular crystallite size, elucidating the results of
recent colloidal experiments. We propose that this crossover in the kinetics is due to the thermally activated
introduction of a disclination charge leading to large internal stresses that result in a fission event, and a
break-up of the remaining crystallite. We have also been developing an alternative, droplet-evaporation
model for the same phenomenon.

- Graph-theoretic Diameter of Random Cluster Models
We use Swendsen-Wang Monte Carlo simulations in order to measure the scaling behavior of the fractal
dimension d D of the diameter D of q-state Potts Model clusters, where D is defined in the graph-theoretic
sense of the ‚Äúlongest shortest path‚Äù along bonds in a cluster. We have developed a novel algorithm for
determining D efficiently, and present results for q = 1, 2, 3, 4 in 2D and 3D lattices. We are attempting to
relate the scaling exponent for D to other known exponents.

- Packing of Polygons on Compact Geometries
We employ analytic and simulated annealing methods to study the packing of squares on a flat torus, and
have found a rich array of dense packing solutions. Future work will include using the recent population
annealing algortihm to explore the densest packings of additional shapes in finite and compact geometries.

- Computational Complexity
Motivated both by recent attempts to elucidate the nature of ‚Äúphase transitions‚Äù in computational com-
plexity, and by the general project of characterizing the complexity physical systems according to their
‚Äùparallel computational depth‚Äù, we have explored the parallel computational complexity of the Percolation
(Potts q = 1) model. We have developed an algorithm for identifying infinite clusters at bond occupation
probabilities p above the critical value p c , and we have found (via numerical Monte Carlo simulation) a
phase transition in computational complexity at p c ‚Äì thus relating a phase transition in computational
complexity to a structural phase transition.

- Biophysics
-- Bioscillations: I have begun preliminary research into the synchronization of gene expression oscillations in the cells of
the Mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus, which regulates Circadian rhythms, through the study of a lattice
network of Kuramoto oscillators. 
-- Bacteriophage:  I have also performed Brownian Dynamics simulations of packaging and ejection forces in bacteriophage.

Grants awarded:
- Peter de Florez '38 Humor Fund Committee for the Babbling Brook Project at MIT
An offshoot of this public engagement goal has been The Babbling Brook project. As we discussed ways to engage people, particularly young people and those unfamiliar with water science, we came up with the idea for a networked talking flower that would rise up out of the water and tell very bad jokes to everyone who passed by. The Babbling Brook (so titled because our alpha version was placed in a brook) is a large, red, networked flower sculpture that monitors water conditions in the body of water where it is placed, combines that data with current weather conditions, and proceeds to tell very bad jokes in a Text-to-Speech robot voice about that data.
